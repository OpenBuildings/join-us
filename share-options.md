Share options
=============

As part of our compensation package for engineers, in addition to a monthly salary, we also offer a share options grant.

Share options allow us to give employees a share of the company and involve them into a potential successful exit.

Grant
-----

We will grant you a stock option grant from our UK-based company when you start at Clippings (this is also valid for engineers in Sofia, Bulgaria). This gives you the ability to later exercise the options at the share price of the company when you have started.

It would be vested over 4 years with a 1 year cliff.

Exercising
----------

Exercising is the action when you use your share options to buy stock at your preferable price and sell them at the current price in one operation.

You make a profit on the difference between the stock price when you started and the current stock price when you are exercising for each share option.

> Example:
>
> When you start the stock price is £1.  
> 5 years later at an exit event the stock price is £10  
> For 1,000 share options you could make a profit of £9,000 (`1000 * (£10 - £1)`).

Exercise window
---------------

You can exercise your vested options up to **10 years** after the grant date even if you have left.
Some companies offer short exercise windows or require to exercise them in 90 days if you leave, which we don't believe is fair.

That's why we're proud to be one of the [companies with an extended exercise window](https://github.com/holman/extended-exercise-windows).
