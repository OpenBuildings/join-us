Code
----

We may ask you to send us some recent code you've written and you're proud of.
It may be a small task or a library.
If you have some published open-source packages with tests and a readme, we'd love to check them out!

If you don't have something recent you could share, we could think of a task you'd be comfortable with writing at home.

Ideally, we would like to see well-structured object-oriented code with some information
on what it does and why you've written it like that.

This is the full technical interview. It would usually take from 60 to 90 minutes.

It may consist of questions about:

- your professional experience,
- your education,
- general technical knowledge,
- specific programming questions,
- agile processes,
- tools you use,
- data structures,
- culture.

We don't require candidates to do whiteboard interviews or live coding.
We don't believe that resembles real-life work or correctly represent their knowledge.
