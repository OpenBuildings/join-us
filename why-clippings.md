Why join Clippings?
===================

Here are a few reasons why you would want to join our team:

### Mission and values

Our mission is to redesign the furniture design industry.
This sounds quite bold as most of the industry is operating offline
and quite slow to change, but we see this as an opportunity.

We are fulfilling our vision by creating a platform to directly connect design
brands and individual designers with their end customers - architects, interior
designers and design-conscious consumers. We skip the chain of retailers,
distributors and dealers. By empowering designers we support moving the industry further.

We are a small startup, but aim high and grow quickly.
We've raised Â£2.8m Series A to help us with our mission to redesign the design industry.

### The team

You would be working with highly-engaged team of developers.
We always try to learn new technologies, incorporate the latest best practices and try new things.

We realise everybody has their strong and weak sides and we would help you
learn in various fields - from improving communication with others to latest terminal hacks.

### Our process

We are a small, but effective team working with tools and techniques like
continuous integration, automated unit tests, Scrum and code reviews.
The developers are really close to the product decisions working
directly with the product managers to plan our work.

We open-source a lot of our work and we try to help the community.
We already have some popular packages and we've supported some projects related
to Postmark, Algolia, MailChimp, Guzzle, OmniPay and more.
